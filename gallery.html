              <p>
                The TRS-80 Micro Computer System (TRS-80, later renamed the
                Model I to distinguish it from successors) is a desktop
                microcomputer launched in 1977 and sold by Tandy Corporation
                through their Radio Shack stores. The name is an abbreviation of
                Tandy Radio Shack, Z80 [microprocessor]. It is one of the
                earliest mass-produced and mass-marketed retail home computers.
